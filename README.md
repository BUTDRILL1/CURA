# CURA: Contract Understanding and Risk Analysis with RoBERTa

This repository contains the code and resources for CURA, a machine learning model for contract understanding and risk analysis. CURA utilizes the RoBERTa transformer neural network architecture to analyze contracts and identify associated risks. The model is trained on the Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD) and a dataset of contracts and their associated risks.

## Features

- **Identifies risks associated with a contract using the RoBERTa model**
- **Generates summaries of contracts tailored to the user's needs**
- **Outperforms other methods for identifying risks and generating summaries (based on your research findings)**
